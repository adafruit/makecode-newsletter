## Procedure for copying the MakeCode Newsletter from Adafruit Daily to an ICYMI post on blog.adafruit.com

1.	A good template for looking at the final result is looking at the previous weeks’ post on blog.adafruit.com

2.	Copy all the image files to the Adafruit Blog Wordpress Media area

3.	Go to the email with the newsletter in a web based browser.

4.	Use the browser View Source

5.	Copy all the HTML from the newsletter heading to the end paragraph about contributing. The HTML before and after that is not needed and should not be used.

6.	Paste the HTML into a text editor with search/replace

7.	Search for /assets/mmddyy and replace with https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/20yy/mm
    for example: replace /assets/100719 with https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2019/10 for October 7, 2019

8.	Copy all the resulting text

9.	Open Wordpress and click on the **Text** tab

10.	Paste the changed HTML into Wordpress 

11.	Click the **Visual** tab and the newsletter should appear. The pictures should be in there as long as they were copied with their same file names into the Wordpress Media section and the URLs were changed.

12.	Title the newsletter the same as the title of the adafruitdaily newsletter complete with social media tags. Important: Preface title with “ICYMI: “ and put hashtag #ICYMI in with the other hashtags. Example: “ICYMI: CircuitPython 5 is alive, Device Simulator and more! #Python #Adafruit #CircuitPython #PythonHardware #ICYMI @circuitpython @micropython @ThePSF @Adafruit”

13.	Add the following text in normal paragraph mode to the top before the Newsletter heading
