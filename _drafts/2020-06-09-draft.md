## Education Spotlight

[![Microsoft Build](/assets/06092020/20200609nextgen.jpg)](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/d45b7310-bd32-4598-b2a3-be47e8a0d2e4)

[![GitHub Classroom](../assets/06092020/20200609github.jpg)](https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/)

Microsoft and GitHub announce that they are making online integrated development environments (IDEs) such that students can get right to work in a web browser, avoiding software conflicts that might happen with code installs on their local machines.

Code on a laptop or with a tablet—students won’t be slowed down by their devices. Students can get started quickly in the same coding environment, so educators may teach instead of troubleshooting.

Currently integration includes MakeCode Arcade - [GitHub](https://github.blog/2020-05-26-code-in-the-browser-with-github-classroom/).
