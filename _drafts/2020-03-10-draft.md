## News from around the web!

[![Connected Flowerpot](/assets/03102020/03102020flowerpot.jpg)](https://www.instructables.com/id/Connected-Flowerpot-by-Microbit/)

Instructables user davallot provides a tutorial on a 3D printed flower pot. The pot contains a micro:bit card, housed under the soil container. The micro:bit receives information from the soil moisture sensor (conductivity). Transcription of the soil moisture value is done by means of a ring of 20 RGB (red, green, blue) programmable LEDs (NeoPixels) located on the front. The code is in MakeCode and it is a rather short, easy program. - [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Connected-Flowerpot-by-Microbit/)

[![Physical Computing for Everyone](/assets/03102020/03102020ball.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slUq4ZF5VOA)

Thomas Ball from Microsoft Research discusses, on YouTube, Physical Computing for Everyone - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slUq4ZF5VOA)

> Thanks to Mooreâ€™s Law, embeddable microcontroller-based devices continue to get cheaper, faster, and include more integrated sensors and networking options. In 2016, the BBC and a host of technical partners, including Microsoft, delivered such a physical computing device, the micro:bit, to every 5th grader in the UK. The non-profit Micro:bit Education Foundation (microbit.org), of which Microsoft is a founding partner, was recently created to take the micro:bit global. Over the last year, Microsoft has invested in a new web-based programming platform for physical computing in education, called Microsoft MakeCode (www.makecode.com). This talk describes the design principles behind the platform and the experience with it to date.

Brian T. Jackett blogs about video game analogies and also MakeCode Arcade:

> Recently I found a cool retro game programming platform called MakeCode Arcade. MakeCode Arcade is free, open-source, and entirely accessible through a browser with no installs required.  Similar to MITâ€™s Scratch offering, you can build games using predefined blocks (or JavaScript if you feel like going advanced) that include game logic, sprites, animations, controller input, and more.  You can also play your own games or a whole host of community games through the browser or download your games to a number of hardware devices (most cost less than $40 last I checked).  If you feel like collaborating you can also share your projects on GitHub for others to enjoy and work on.  Iâ€™m looking forward to introducing MakeCode Arcade to my daughter this year to see what she comes up with.

Twitter user Bornach uses a cheap 433MHz ASK module and an inexpensive JYE Tech oscilloscope to capture the radio control packets used to switch Asda MasterPlug sockets on/off. Then a micro:bit is used to play the codes back to control the socket. - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bornach1/status/1233730115932168192)

[![Kitronik BullDozer add on](/assets/03102020/03102020bulldozer.jpg)](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5671-bull-dozer-add-on-for-movemini-mk2.html)

Kitronik has introduced a Bulldozer add-on for their :MOVE mini MK2 for the BBC micro:bit. A favourite little programmable robot buggy just got much better. Robots often do more than just :MOVE from A to B, and with this add-on so can :MOVE mini. - [Kitronik](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5671-bull-dozer-add-on-for-movemini-mk2.html)

[![Kitronik ZIP Tile for BBC microbit](/assets/03102020/03102020zip.jpg)](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5645-zip-tile.html)

Kitronik also carries an 8x8 tile of NeoPixels (RGB color smart LEDs), the ZIP Tile for BBC micro:bit. The ZIP bolts directly onto the micro:bit. They have also produced a set of custom blocks for the MakeCode Editor to make the job of coding for them as simple as possible. - [Kitronik](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/5645-zip-tile.html)
