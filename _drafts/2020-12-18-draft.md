## Space Jam: A New Legacy and MakeCode

[![MakeCode Arcade Space Jam](/assets/20201218/20201218jam2.jpg)](https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2020/12/learn-to-code-with-materials-inspired-by-space-jam-a-new-legacy/)

Space Jam: A New Legacy is inspiring unique learning opportunities for students of all ages! Basketball and coding have more in common than you might think; they both require practice, creativity, and coaching. That’s why we’ve teamed up to bring educators and students learning materials inspired by the film.

Learn to code at your own pace with Space Jam: A New Legacy on Microsoft Learn.

- Check out the [lessons](https://aka.ms/ExploreSportsWithCode/) and [workshops](https://aka.ms/microsoftstorecoding) around coding, data science, machine learning, and web development available to you today!
- For the more advanced learner, there is a new learning path on [Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/ExploreSportsWithCode/) that will guide students through writing Python and JavaScript using [Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/LearnOnVSCode) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

Sign up for online coding workshops hosted by Microsoft Store - [Microsoft Education](https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2020/12/learn-to-code-with-materials-inspired-by-space-jam-a-new-legacy/).

> In this 90-minute online workshop, titled “Space Jam: A New Legacy coding workshop,” students ages eight and older will have the opportunity to build a playable prototype of a videogame with block-based coding on the MakeCode Arcade platform while learning about the professional skills and STEAM careers that are involved in game design. Parents and students can sign up for the [Space Jam: A New Legacy coding workshop online](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/workshops-training-and-events/space-jam-a-new-legacy) and find additional resources and other free workshops that teach new skills and keep kids entertained this holiday season on the [virtual student workshop page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/workshops-training-and-events/students). We’ve also created an educator version of these trainings that makes it easier for teachers to incorporate STEAM lessons in their curricula in the hope of amplifying opportunities for learning. Educators can [download Microsoft Store Space Jam: A New Legacy curriculum](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fworkshops-training-and-events%2Fspace-jam-a-new-legacy%2Feducators&data=04%7C01%7CChristina.Baselice%40edelman.com%7C4da6b3ab5d284165f73708d89e1032eb%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637433139709814514%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=BXxHVxKuiDdNo39%2Bx9V8e5OdLspAGLPTG%2Bou8904Jx4%3D&reserved=0) for some exciting Space Jam: A New Legacy coding fun with students today.

[![A micro:bit Animal Tracker](/assets/20201218/20201218tracker2.jpg)](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/animal-tracker/)

Use the micro:bit's accelerometer and radio features to make a prototype of a device to help scientists track polar bears or other animals and discover how they are being affected by climate change.

This project is part of a series created to offer problem-solving and prototyping activities designed to explore technology as a solution to the challenges of the Global Goals for Sustainable Development.

## MakeCode for micro:bit V2

[![MakeCode for micro:bit V2](/assets/20201218/20201218mmv2.jpg)](https://makecode.com/blog/microbit/microbit-V2)

The MakeCode team announces MakeCode for micro:bit V2:

> We spent a lot of time making sure that whether students were using a V1 or V2 version of the micro:bit, they would have a seamless experience in MakeCode. All the MakeCode blocks will work with the new micro:bit. Some blocks will only work with the new micro:bit, but these blocks have been clearly marked as V2 in the MakeCode Toolbox.
