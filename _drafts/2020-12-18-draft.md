## MakeCode for micro:bit V2

[![MakeCode for micro:bit V2](/assets/20201218/20201218mmv2.jpg)](https://makecode.com/blog/microbit/microbit-V2)

The MakeCode team announces MakeCode for micro:bit V2:

> We spent a lot of time making sure that whether students were using a V1 or V2 version of the micro:bit, they would have a seamless experience in MakeCode. All the MakeCode blocks will work with the new micro:bit. Some blocks will only work with the new micro:bit, but these blocks have been clearly marked as V2 in the MakeCode Toolbox.
