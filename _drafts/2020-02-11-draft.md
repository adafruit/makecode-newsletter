## What is Microsoft MakeCode?
Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming.

**Simulator**

[![Simulator](/assets/08142019/81419sim.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

An interactive simulator provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

**Block Editor**

[![Block Editor](/assets/08142019/81419block.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

Students new to coding can start with colored blocks that they can drag and drop onto their workspace to construct their programs.

**JavaScript Editor**

[![JavaScript Editor](/assets/08142019/81419jsed.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

When they are ready, students can move into a full-featured JavaScript editor with code snippets, tooltips, and error detection to help them.

## MakeCode Arcade
