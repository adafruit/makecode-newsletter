## Latest Releases

![A 'create Github repository' button](/assets/10072019/100719-makecode-github-1.png)

In the latest round of MakeCode updates, Microsoft has integrated more GitHub features into MakeCode which allows users to stay right where they are without having to jump between both MakeCode and GitHub. To host ones MakeCode in a GitHub repository, Microsoft added a “create GitHub repository” button under the simulator.

![A github repository status](/assets/10072019/100719-makecode-github-2.png) 

Once the project is associated to a GitHub repository, the `create GitHub repository` button becomes a status bar. It shows the GitHub project name (and the branch if it’s not **master**) and an up arrow if you have local changes.

The new GitHub authoring **reloaded** feature is currently available in:

*   `/beta` version of [micro:bit editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/beta)
*   `/beta` version of [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta)
*   `/beta` version of [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://makecode.adafruit.com/beta)
*   The [Maker Editor](https://maker.makecode.com/)

Read more about this on the [MakeCode blog](https://makecode.com/blog/github-extensions-episode-2).

![Airlift Support in MakeCode Arcade beta](/assets/10072019/100719-makecode-airlift.png) 

The beta version of [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta) also has preliminary support for the [Adafruit Airlift](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4201) WiFi coprocessor.

## What is Microsoft MakeCode?
Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming.

**Simulator**

[![Simulator](/assets/08142019/81419sim.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

An interactive simulator provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

**Block Editor**

[![Block Editor](/assets/08142019/81419block.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

Students new to coding can start with colored blocks that they can drag and drop onto their workspace to construct their programs.

**JavaScript Editor**

[![JavaScript Editor](/assets/08142019/81419jsed.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

When they are ready, students can move into a full-featured JavaScript editor with code snippets, tooltips, and error detection to help them.
