## Opening a World of Possibilities
[![](/assets/01142020/lakehills.jpg)](https://www.heraldargus.com/news/opening-a-world-of-possibilities/article_61f48c13-a8e6-52cf-946c-3211d5e215b7.html)

From the Week of Code at Lake Hills Elementary School in Michigan City, IN: "_Engaged is the best way to describe Lake Hills Elementary School fifth-graders as they took part in National Week of Code activities._

_With the help of David Fink, Youth Services Librarian at Michigan City Public Library, they were introduced to the BBC Microbit, a tiny microcontroller; and the Microsoft MakeCode website, a free, open source coding platform – all designed to make learning computer science fun and easy._

_Fink said that was the goal – to show students possibilities. 'My main objective today was to show the students that coding opens a world of possibilities for creativity and expression, and that each student has meaningful ideas that significantly influence what that world of possibilities can be.'_

_Students programmed their microbits with animated light displays and music, Fink said. Some had fun displaying special messages. And, headphones were “hacked” by building a circuit with alligator clips connected to the microbit and a headphone jack. Students could then listen to their coded, musical creations._" - [Herald-Argus](https://www.heraldargus.com/news/opening-a-world-of-possibilities/article_61f48c13-a8e6-52cf-946c-3211d5e215b7.html)

## Educator Spotlight

[![](/assets/01142020/helenavatar.jpg)](https://twitter.com/helenleigh)

[Helen Leigh](https://twitter.com/helenleigh) is a hacker, writer, musician, speaker, educator, artist, and self-professed nerd! She wrote [The Crafy Kid's Guide to DIY Electronics](https://www.amazon.com/Crafty-Kids-Guide-DIY-Electronics/dp/1260142833/) and made the [MINI-MU glove kit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4141). Helen recently created a video series with the British Council on learning programming with the Micro:bit in MakeCode. 

In her words, “Last year I filmed a series of videos that teach you how to use [@microbit_edu](https://twitter.com/microbit_edu), [@MSMakeCode](https://twitter.com/MSMakeCode) & how to get started with Python. The course is totally free, plus if you complete all 12 modules you get a fancy certificate from the [@BritishCouncil](https://twitter.com/BritishCouncil). This course was designed for teachers but anyone who wants to learn about Microbit will love it. Totally suitable for beginners or those looking to take the next step in Physical Computing.

## Latest Releases

### MakeCode Arcade now in General Availability

[![](/assets/01142020/01142020-MC-Arcade-GenRelease.png)](https://makecode.com/blog/arcade/general-release)

"The MakeCode team is very happy and proud to announce that MakeCode Arcade has been officially released for general availability today!

For those of you who have been following our progress, you’ll know that we’ve been working on MakeCode Arcade for about 2 years now… and we’ve had it in Beta for the past year while we’ve continued to get feedback, fix bugs, make improvements and just generally polish up the experience.

Huge thanks to everyone who has been using the Beta version, filing bugs and offering us suggestions (shout-outs to Kevin J Walters and Alex Kulcsar for helping us find a lot of great bugs!). Also big thanks to our amazing hardware partners who have worked with us to make super fun Arcade-compatible game devices that really bring the Arcade games to life! Check them out here – https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware." - [Blog](https://makecode.com/blog/arcade/general-release) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/UCq1VUIqpHI)

Among the items that are in the release is a new tile editor

[![](/assets/01142020/01142020-tilemap-editor.gif)](https://forum.makecode.com/t/news-upcoming-tilemap-editor-for-arcade/839)

Features include:

- See your tiles in the editor: Instead of an image that maps to tiles, you can now see the tiles directly in the map you are editing
- 256 tiles per map: Up from the previous limit of 16
- Only one block required: No more assigning images to colors; tiles are created inside the same editor as the map and shared between all tilemaps in your project
- Draw walls anywhere: You can now paint walls directly onto the map
- Tile gallery: Use any MakeCode Arcade built-in tile assets easily

## What is Microsoft MakeCode?
Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming.

**Simulator**

[![Simulator](/assets/08142019/81419sim.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

An interactive simulator provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

**Block Editor**

[![Block Editor](/assets/08142019/81419block.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

Students new to coding can start with colored blocks that they can drag and drop onto their workspace to construct their programs.

**JavaScript Editor**

[![JavaScript Editor](/assets/08142019/81419jsed.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

When they are ready, students can move into a full-featured JavaScript editor with code snippets, tooltips, and error detection to help them.

## MakeCode Arcade

[![MakeCode Arcade](/assets/08142019/arcade.png)](https://arcade.makecode.com/)

Microsoft MakeCode Arcade is a web-based beginner-friendly code editor to create retro arcade games for the web and for microcontrollers. In this guide, you will learn how to assemble your own Arcade hardware from different parts. MakeCode Arcade is open source, and on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade).

A MakeCode Arcade overview video is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCq1VUIqpHI).
