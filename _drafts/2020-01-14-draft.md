[MakeCode with GitHub](https://makecode.com/blog/makecode-with-github) GitHub integration continues to grow inside of MakeCode! _This blog post is a continuation in a series posts documenting the integration of GitHub authoring in MakeCode. In the previous two episodes, we introduced integrated GitHub authoring experience for extensions; then we discussed the new support for diffing and branching._

[![](/assets/01142020/01142020-MC-Arcade-GenRelease.png)](https://makecode.com/blog/arcade/general-release)

"The MakeCode team is very happy and proud to announce that MakeCode Arcade has been officially released for general availability today!

For those of you who have been following our progress, you’ll know that we’ve been working on MakeCode Arcade for about 2 years now… and we’ve had it in Beta for the past year while we’ve continued to get feedback, fix bugs, make improvements and just generally polish up the experience.

Huge thanks to everyone who has been using the Beta version, filing bugs and offering us suggestions (shout-outs to Kevin J Walters and Alex Kulcsar for helping us find a lot of great bugs!). Also big thanks to our amazing hardware partners who have worked with us to make super fun Arcade-compatible game devices that really bring the Arcade games to life! Check them out here – https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware." - [Blog](https://makecode.com/blog/arcade/general-release) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/UCq1VUIqpHI)

Among the items that are in the release is a new tile editor

[![](/assets/01142020/01142020-tilemap-editor.gif)](https://forum.makecode.com/t/news-upcoming-tilemap-editor-for-arcade/839)

Features include:

- See your tiles in the editor: Instead of an image that maps to tiles, you can now see the tiles directly in the map you are editing
- 256 tiles per map: Up from the previous limit of 16
- Only one block required: No more assigning images to colors; tiles are created inside the same editor as the map and shared between all tilemaps in your project
- Draw walls anywhere: You can now paint walls directly onto the map
- Tile gallery: Use any MakeCode Arcade built-in tile assets easily

## What is Microsoft MakeCode?
Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming.

**Simulator**

[![Simulator](/assets/08142019/81419sim.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

An interactive simulator provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

**Block Editor**

[![Block Editor](/assets/08142019/81419block.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

Students new to coding can start with colored blocks that they can drag and drop onto their workspace to construct their programs.

**JavaScript Editor**
