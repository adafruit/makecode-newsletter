## Latest Releases

[![Cloud Sync for MakeCode Arcade](/assets/20210827/20210827sync.gif)](https://makecode.com/blog/arcade/in)

Introducing Cloud Sync for MakeCode Arcade - [MakeCode Blog](https://makecode.com/blog/arcade/in).

> Over the past year we’ve been working hard to bring you the ability to sign into MakeCode with a Microsoft Account. When you sign into MakeCode, you make it possible for us to remember who you are, and this unlocks a bunch of exciting new possibilities. For example, it becomes possible for us to remember what you were working on and make your projects available wherever you use MakeCode. In fact this is the first feature we’ve built for our signed in users, and we’re calling it Cloud Sync.
