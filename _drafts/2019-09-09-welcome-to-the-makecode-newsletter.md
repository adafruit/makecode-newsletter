## BKLYN Fashion Academy Class of 2019 Shines at Runway Show

[![Fashion forward: Researchers, designers debut new tech on New York City runway](http://img.youtube.com/vi/TvSmYga2Pic/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvSmYga2Pic "Fashion forward: Researchers, designers debut new tech on New York City runway")

[BKLYN Fashion Academy Class of 2019 Shines at Runway Show](https://bklyner.com/bklyn-fashion-academy-class-of-2019-shines-at-runway-show/) - wearable technology sponsored by Microsoft Research and Microsoft MakeCode.

Microsoft researchers teamed up with designers at the Brooklyn Public Library’s BKLYN Fashion Academy to enhance the storytelling power of their garments using custom-made plug-and-play microcontroller technology. The collaboration culminated in a fashion show on May 3 at the Brooklyn Public Library’s Central Library in New York City. The tech was the first application of [Project Alava](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/alava), which aims to lower the barriers of entry to programming by creating microcontroller-based systems that are easy to construct, code and debug. Alava leverages the open-source framework powering Microsoft MakeCode and the bus-based communication protocol [JACDAC](https://jacdac.org).

>_"[James Devine](https://twitter.com/James_A_Devine), a student at Lancaster University’s School of Computing and Communications, has developed a new communication technology called JACDAC that helps different tiny embedded computers known as microcontrollers talk to each other more easily. JACDAC can be described as the USB for the wired Internet of Things (IoT) and simplifies the connecting of microcontrollers featuring different sensors and capabilities. JACDAC enables a network of microcontrollers to work together in highly dynamic environments, yet, makes doing so as simple as plugging a pair of headphones into a 3.5mm socket. Mr. Devine developed JACDAC as part of an internship at Microsoft Research in the United States. His software was originally designed to help develop a multiplayer aspect to Microsoft’s MakeCode Arcade – a web-based application that lets people create their own games for handheld gaming devices."

## LED Dog Collar made with JavaScript in MakeCode

[![I made a LED dog collar with JavaScript](/assets/09092019/dogcollar.gif)](https://medium.com/@secretsquirrel/i-made-a-led-dog-collar-with-javascript-1c10ff973550)

>_"JavaScript is truly EVERYWHERE, and now I’ve even added it to my dog. I was most excited to try the MakeCode Editor and finally write code for my wearables in JavaScript instead of hacking C++(ish) code together! So, I obviously used this opportunity to make a fancy collar my doggo for night walks. He’s a good boye and totally deserves a special collar. I also think that the steps in this build could just as easily be applied to other lighted apparel applications like adding some LEDs to your denim jacket or backpack or hat or -insert your awesome idea here-...

## Bots! Robotics Engineering with Hands-On Makerspace Activities

[![Bots Robotics Engineering with Hands-On Makerspace Activities](/assets/09092019/9919botsbook.jpg)](https://nomadpress.net/nomadpress-books/bots-robotics-engineering/)

**Build and Program a Recycled Robot with MakeCode!** by [Kathy Ceceri](https://twitter.com/KathyCeceri)!

>_"Robots are everywhere! They vacuum our houses, work in our factories, help us learn at school, and play with us at home. They sample rocks from other planets, survey disaster zones from the air, and bring back images from the bottom of the ocean. In Bots! Robotics Engineering with Hands-On Makerspace Activities, kids ages 9 to 12 learn about the systems that help robots operate—the bodies that determine how they move, sensors that tell them what's going on around them, artificial intelligence that lets them figure out what to do next, and more! Explore the history of robots with fascinating facts and profiles of people working in this exciting STEM field. Bots! explores how art, psychology, and biology make robots easier to talk to and let them do things people can’t, such as slither or fly. And you'll get a peek at research that may someday bring us the robots of tomorrow."_

## What is Microsoft MakeCode?
Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming.

**Simulator**

[![Simulator](/assets/08142019/81419sim.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

An interactive simulator provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

**Block Editor**

[![Block Editor](/assets/08142019/81419block.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

Students new to coding can start with colored blocks that they can drag and drop onto their workspace to construct their programs.

**JavaScript Editor**

[![JavaScript Editor](/assets/08142019/81419jsed.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

When they are ready, students can move into a full-featured JavaScript editor with code snippets, tooltips, and error detection to help them.

## MakeCode Arcade

[![MakeCode Arcade](/assets/08142019/arcade.png)](https://arcade.makecode.com/)
