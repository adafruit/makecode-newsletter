## Educator Spotlight

[![](/assets/12032019/12102019-morrill.png/)](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/intro/author)

[Rob Morrill](https://twitter.com/morrill_rob) is the Maker Lab Coordinator for [St. Matthew’s Episcopal School](http://stmatthewsday.org/), in San Mateo, California. He teaches 1st through 8th grade technology skills classes, designs and facilitates projects in the maker lab, and collaborates, advises, and trains other faculty members in their use of academic technology. He is the author of the [Maker Course for the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker) available online.

In his own words, “Academic technology and maker-style projects and challenges have the potential to help students see themselves as creators more than consumers, and as problem-seekers and solvers. This mindset development is the most exciting aspect of technology and maker work for me. The wealth of tools and resources available gives teachers and students many choices, and I work to create, curate, and publicize those opportunities.”

### Interview: Christina Zhang from Kittenbot, maker of the Meowbit and other maker products.

Adafruit recently held a Q&A with Christina Zhang from Kittenbot! Here is the take:

**The Meowbit uses the STM32F4 processor for running MakeCode Arcade. What guided your choice of the STM32F4 processor?**

The start of the Meowbit project dates back to November 2018. Our programmer accidently found MakeCode Arcade and Big Brain Pad Codal support in GitHub. So he made the first version of a hardware prototype and showed it at the 2018 Shenzhen MakerFaire.

**An SD slot is novel and not found often in MakeCode Arcade boards, can you tell us more about your choice to include it?**

The initial plan of SD slot was for SD card support in MicroPython mode, but we found many users require wireless support for MakeCode Arcade. And we design a tiny SD size bluetooth module, also based on codal-microbit.

**Did you work with the Microsoft team on adding the multiplayer connector?**

Not actually. We define our self as a hardware provider, who provides services for STEM educators. But we have some big plans for Jacdac devices. Actually we have finished 8 electronic modules and a jac bus servo (the injected mold cost a lot, both money and time.)

**Not many non-micro:bit boards use the connection format. What guided your choice of embracing it?**

Micro:bit is very popular back in China, we just ride on the flow.

**What is the most exciting use for Meowbit that you've seen?**

One of our customers (a primary school teacher) made "Tank Battalion" with multiplayer support.

**Have you considered working to make Meowbit CircuitPython compatible?**

Yes, of course. But we are not sure what are Adafruit's guidelines to a hardware company.

**Do you see additional MakeCode compatible products in Kittenbot's future?**

We have Bridge the board as our second Makecode Arcade compatible board now, it is basically a extension of Metro M4. And we have finished the arcade shield and CNC/3D printer shield is on the horizon. Here are pictures of the Bridge Arcade Shield:

## Hardware

[Adafruit Gear for MakeCode](https://www.adafruit.com/explore/makecode-arcade)

[![](/assets/12032019/12102019-adafruit.png/)](https://www.adafruit.com/explore/makecode-arcade)

Adafruit has created a new area on their site to showcase Microsoft Arcade-compatible hardware.

- Everyone grows up wanting to make video games - whether zappin' aliens or exploring underground caverns, video games take us to other worlds to live out fantastic adventures. What isn't a fantastic adventure is how complicated writing game the traditional way can be. It's really hard! 

- That's why the MakeCode team came up with Arcade, a drag-n-drop way to develop games that takes care of all the grungy parts and let you get straight to the fun parts. You can write MakeCode Arcade games in any browser, then deploy to a hand-held like the PyBadge, PyGamer or MeowBit. It even works on a Raspberry Pi Zero if you want to play on an HDMI TV! We've got guides to help you get started, even if you've never programmed or designed a game before.

## What is Microsoft MakeCode?
Microsoft MakeCode is a free, open source platform for creating engaging computer science learning experiences that support a progression path into real-world programming.

**Simulator**

[![Simulator](/assets/08142019/81419sim.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

An interactive simulator provides students with immediate feedback on how their program is running and makes it easy to test and debug their code.

**Block Editor**

[![Block Editor](/assets/08142019/81419block.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)

Students new to coding can start with colored blocks that they can drag and drop onto their workspace to construct their programs.

**JavaScript Editor**

[![JavaScript Editor](/assets/08142019/81419jsed.jpg)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode/about)
