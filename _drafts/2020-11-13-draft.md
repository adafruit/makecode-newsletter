Pete Prodoehl has a marvelous MakeCode project just out. A LEGO Ferris Wheel is made even more awesome, thanks to the addition of a [micro:bit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3530) to light it up and spin the wheel. The Crazy Circuits Bit Board, coupled with the micro:bit, will allow the circuit to control the spinning and [NeoPixel lighting](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2562) of the Ferris Wheel with the push of a button! - [Brown Dog Gadgets](https://browndoggadgets.dozuki.com/Guide/Ferris+Wheel/252).
