## Microsoft Launches the MakeCode Arcade Beginner Skillmap

[![Beginner Skillmap](/assets/20210530/20210530skill.jpg)](https://makecode.com/blog/arcade/beginner-skillmap)

The MakeCode Team is super excited to launch the Beginner Skillmap experience, which is a guided introduction to coding through a series of fun tutorials. The Beginner Skillmap is perfect for students learning from home who may be new to computer science. Students will get to build 3 basic games: Storytelling, Clicker, and Dino Run. 

> The MakeCode Arcade Beginner Skillmap was designed to help address the rise of students learning at home, and improve the current inequities found globally today in computer science education. This lack of diversity stems, in part, from the belief that programming is too hard or too boring. The Beginner Skillmap is designed to provide a simple drag-and-drop interface that engages students through an exciting and purposeful first set of coding experiences.

## New Free Curriculum! AP Computer Science Principles with MakeCode

[![AP Computer Science Principles](/assets/20210530/20210530ap.jpg)](https://makecode.com/blog/csp/new-free-curriculum)

Are you planning to teach the [AP Computer Science Principles course](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles) next year? If so, you may want to take a look at some new curriculum Microsoft has published that uses [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) as the programming tool.

It’s a really fun course that was written and tested in the classroom by [Kelli Etheredge](https://twitter.com/ketheredge), an AP Computer Science Principles teacher herself. It was written so teachers new to Computer Science could pick it up and teach – concepts are explained in plain language, daily materials and talking points are provided, and all solutions are included.

There are 9 units in the course that map to the AP CS Principles curriculum framework and prepare students for the AP CSP exam. Microsoft is recognized by the College Board as an endorsed provider of curriculum and professional development for AP® Computer Science Principles (AP CSP).

There are three free workshops this summer in June and July.
