## News from around the web!

[![Smart Garden Project](/assets/20200811/20200811smart.jpg)](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/smart-garden-ornaments)

Ever wanted to track things happening in your garden, neighborhood or school using smart garden ornaments? Now you can using BBC micro:bits and a cloud-based IoT service. Each smart garden ornament is based around a BBC micro:bit, programmed using Microsoft MakeCode. These micro:bits sit inside whatever ornament you have, such as a bird box or garden gnome, and gather data about the outside world - also know as telemetry - [GitHub](https://github.com/jimbobbennett/smart-garden-ornaments).

Using the KB-link (KittenBot Nano:bit’s programming daughterboard) to program a System-on-Module PTR5518 to blink micro:bit’s P8 using pins.digitalWritePin(DigitalPin.P8, 1). This pin translates to P0.18 on the NRF51822. It then sends the number out over radio using radio.sendNumber(c) to a regular Micro:bit which uses radio.onReceivedNumber to display this with basic.showNumber(receivedNumber) - [MakeCode Forums](https://forum.makecode.com/t/another-new-target-arrived-onto-the-scene-kittenbot-nano-bit-micro-bit-compatible/668/9).
