## Procedure for copying the MakeCode Newsletter from Adafruit Daily to an ICYMI post on blog.adafruit.com

1.	A good template for looking at the final result is looking at the previous weeks’ post on blog.adafruit.com

2.	Download the issues images to your computer from GitHub. Then copy all the image files to the Adafruit Blog Wordpress Media area

3.	Go to https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/makecode/ in a browser and find the latest adafruitdaily blog entry and click on it. Alternatively get the newsletter from your inbox.
4.	Use the browser View Source

5.	Copy all the HTML from the newsletter heading to the end paragraph about contributing. The HTML before and after that is not needed and should not be used.

6.	Paste the HTML into an editor with search/replace

7.	Search for cdn-daily-blog.adafruitdaily.com and replace with cdn-blog.adafruit.com

8.	Copy all the text

9.	Open Wordpress and click on the **Text** tab

10.	Paste the changed HTML into Wordpress 

11.	Click the **Visual** tab and the newsletter should appear. The pictures should be in there as long as they were copied with their same file names into the Wordpress Media section and the URLs were changed.

12.	The “Click this link to open this email in a browser”, if at the top of the text should be deleted.

13.	Title the newsletter the same as the title of the adafruitdaily newsletter complete with social media tags. Important: Preface title with “ICYMI: “ and put hashtag #ICYMI in with the other hashtags. Example: “ICYMI: CircuitPython 5 is alive, Device Simulator and more! #Python #Adafruit #CircuitPython #PythonHardware #ICYMI @circuitpython @micropython @ThePSF @Adafruit”

14.	Add the following text in normal paragraph mode to the top before the Newsletter heading

ICYMI (In case you missed it) – MakeCode Newsletter from AdafruitDaily.com went out – if you missed it, subscribe now!

The next newsletter goes out in a week and being subscribed the best way to keep up with all things MakeCode.

15.	Add Categories: ADAFRUIT DAILY, MAKECODE, PUBLICATIONS

16.	Add Tags: ADAFRUIT DAILY, NEWSLETTER, MAKECODE

17.	As far as the lower right Featured Image, we don't have a standard one yet, maybe create one?

18.	Do a double check that all looks ok. Most of the copyedit was done in the adafruitdaily publication. Make sure the background is white and the text is not centered

19.	Set Schedule for whenever PT wants. Then click the Blue Schedule button.
